## Haaga-Helia helper

This program will be a tool for every student in Haaga-Helia. I will be 
gathering all the meaningful information to one app. Mainly my goals are 
to gather information from different APIs. There is also my own backend 
where it is possible to save Moodle courses and access them with just 
one click. 

## Technologies 

This will be made with React.js, Node.js and MongoDB.
