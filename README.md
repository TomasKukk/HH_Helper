## Haaga-Helia helper

This web application is built to serve every student in Haaga-Helia. It gathers most important information you need for studying in one page.
In practice this means offering lunch menus, timetables, parties and common links used. Also there will be a raspberry pi in the Pasila cafeteria sending pictures to my backend every minute. I will be fetching this picture and showing the queue for the cafeteria in the web application. 

Raspberry pi project can be found in https://github.com/tomaskukk/raspberry-cafeteria-traffic

## Technologies 

Made with React.js, Node.js. E2E tests are made with Cypress.

### What the future holds

I am looking to make this application run using kubernetes. I would like to have continuous integration and some scaling so new versions can be launched easliy.
